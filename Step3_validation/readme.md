To scan the GlobPOP products fully and thoroughly, we employed the validation in three aspects. 

For spatial validation, we used four indicators ("R^2" , RMSE, MAE, and Relative Entropy) to explore the overall accuracy in 217 countries and nine countries’ level-2 regions. 

As for the temporal validation, the time-series curve similarities and trend analysis were taken into consideration.

We also investigated the accountability of GlobPOP to estimate population in the rarely populated land cover areas at pixel scale, five different land cover types (cropland, forest, wetland, desert, and snow) were selected to test the data.
