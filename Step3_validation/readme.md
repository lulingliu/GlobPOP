To scan the GlobPOP products fully and thoroughly, we employed the validation in three aspects. 

For spatial validation, we used four indicators ("R^2" , RMSE, MAE, and Relative Entropy) to explore the overall accuracy in 217 countries and nine countriesâ€™ level-2 regions. 

As for the temporal validation, the time-series curve similarities and trend analysis were taken into consideration. And we have expanded our temporal validation by developing an interactive web application, accessible at *https://globpop.shinyapps.io/GlobPOP/*, where users can explore the population time series data of all 217 countries.

We also investigated the accountability of GlobPOP to estimate population in the rarely populated land cover areas at pixel scale, five different land cover types (cropland, forest, wetland, desert, and snow) were selected to test the data.
